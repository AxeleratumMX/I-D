Authorization Server
====================

The Authorization Server provides several endpoints for authorization, issuing
tokens, refreshing tokens and revoking tokens. When the resource owner (user)
grants the authorization, this server will issue an access token to the client.

Before creating the authorization server, we need to understand several
concepts:

Resource Owner
--------------

Resource Owner is the user who is using your service. A resource owner can
log in your website with username/email and password, or other methods.

A resource owner SHOULD implement ``get_user_id()`` method, lets take
SQLAlchemy models for example::

    class User(Model):
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        # other columns

        def get_user_id(self):
            return self.id

Client
------

A client is an application making protected resource requests on behalf of the
resource owner and with its authorization. It contains at least three
information:

- Client Identifier, usually called **client_id**
- Client Password, usually called **client_secret**
- Client Token Endpoint Authentication Method

Authlib has provided a mixin for SQLAlchemy, define the client with this mixin::

    from authlib.flask.oauth2.sqla import OAuth2ClientMixin

    class Client(Model, OAuth2ClientMixin):
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        user_id = Column(
            Integer, ForeignKey('user.id', ondelete='CASCADE')
        )
        user = relationship('User')

A client is registered by a user (developer) on your website. If you decide to
implement all the missing methods by yourself, get a deep inside with
:class:`~authlib.oauth2.rfc6749.ClientMixin` API reference.

Token
-----

.. note::

    Only Bearer Token is supported by now. MAC Token is still under drafts,
    it will be available when it goes into RFC.

Tokens are used to access the users' resources. A token is issued with a
valid duration, limited scopes and etc. It contains at least:

- **access_token**: a token to authorize the http requests.
- **refresh_token**: (optional) a token to exchange a new access token
- **client_id**: this token is issued to which client
- **expires_at**: when will this token expired
- **scope**: a limited scope of resources that this token can access

With the SQLAlchemy mixin provided by Authlib::

    from authlib.flask.oauth2.sqla import OAuth2TokenMixin

    class Token(db.Model, OAuth2TokenMixin):
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        user_id = db.Column(
            db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id', ondelete='CASCADE')
        )
        user = db.relationship('User')

A token is associated with a resource owner. There is no certain name for
it, here we call it ``user``, but it can be anything else.

Server
------

Authlib provides a ready to use :class:`~authlib.flask.oauth2.AuthorizationServer`
which has built-in tools to handle requests and responses::

    from authlib.flask.oauth2 import AuthorizationServer

    def query_client(client_id):
        return Client.query.filter_by(client_id=client_id).first()

    def save_token(token, request):
        if request.user:
            user_id = request.user.get_user_id()
        else:
            # client_credentials grant_type
            user_id = request.client.user_id
            # or, depending on how you treat client_credentials
            user_id = None
        item = Token(
            client_id=request.client.client_id,
            user_id=user_id,
            **token
        )
        db.session.add(item)
        db.session.commit()

    # or with the helper
    from authlib.flask.oauth2.sqla import (
        create_query_client_func,
        create_save_token_func
    )
    query_client = create_query_client_func(db.session, Client)
    save_token = create_save_token_func(db.session, Token)

    server = AuthorizationServer(
        app, query_client=query_client, save_token=save_token
    )

It can also be initialized lazily with init_app::

    server = AuthorizationServer()
    server.init_app(app, query_client=query_client, save_token=save_token)

It works well without configuration. However, it can be configured with these
settings:

================================== ==================================================
OAUTH2_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN            A dict to define ``expires_in`` for each grant
OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN_GENERATOR      A function or string of module path for importing
                                   a function to generate ``access_token``
OAUTH2_REFRESH_TOKEN_GENERATOR     A function or string of module path for importing
                                   a function to generate ``refresh_token``. It can
                                   also be ``True/False``
OAUTH2_ERROR_URIS                  A list of tuple for (``error``, ``error_uri``)
================================== ==================================================

.. hint::

    Here is an example of ``OAUTH2_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN``::

        OAUTH2_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN = {
            'authorization_code': 864000,
            'implicit': 3600,
            'password': 864000,
            'client_credentials': 864000
        }

    Here is an example of ``OAUTH2_ACCESS_TOKEN_GENERATOR``::

        def gen_access_token(client, grant_type, user, scope):
            return create_some_random_string()

    ``OAUTH2_REFRESH_TOKEN_GENERATOR`` accepts the same parameters.

Now define an endpoint for authorization. This endpoint is used by
``authorization_code`` and ``implicit`` grants::

    from flask import request, render_template
    from your_project.auth import current_user

    @app.route('/oauth/authorize', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def authorize():
        # Login is required since we need to know the current resource owner.
        # It can be done with a redirection to the login page, or a login
        # form on this authorization page.
        if request.method == 'GET':
            grant = server.validate_consent_request(end_user=current_user)
            return render_template(
                'authorize.html',
                grant=grant,
                user=current_user,
            )
        confirmed = request.form['confirm']
        if confirmed:
            # granted by resource owner
            return server.create_authorization_response(current_user)
        # denied by resource owner
        return server.create_authorization_response(None)

This is a simple demo, the real case should be more complex. There is a demo
in `authlib/playground`_, get a real taste with Authlib Playground.

The token endpoint is much easier::

    @app.route('/oauth/token', methods=['POST'])
    def issue_token():
        return server.create_token_response()

However, the routes will not work properly. We need to register supported
grants for them.

Register Error URIs
-------------------

To create a better developer experience for debugging, it is suggested that
you creating some documentation for errors. Here is a list of built-in
:ref:`specs/rfc6949-errors`.

You can design a documentation page with a description of each error. For
instance, there is a web page for ``invalid_client``::

   https://developer.your-company.com/errors#invalid-client

In this case, you can register the error URI with ``OAUTH2_ERROR_URIS``
configuration::

   OAUTH2_ERROR_URIS = [
      ('invalid_client', 'https://developer.your-company.com/errors#invalid-client'),
      # other error URIs
   ]

If there is no ``OAUTH2_ERROR_URIS``, the error response will not contain any
``error_uri`` data.

I18N on Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to add i18n support to the ``error_description``. The
feature has been implemented in version 0.8, but there are still work to do.
